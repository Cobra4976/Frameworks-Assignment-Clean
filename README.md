# Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using **Python**, with libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.
It loads datasets, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generates simple plots to visualize key insights.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
.
├── metadata.csv          # Dataset file (ignored in git)
├── venv/                 # Virtual environment (ignored in git)
├── __pycache__/          # Compiled Python cache files (ignored in git)
├── .ipynb_checkpoints/   # Jupyter notebook checkpoints (ignored in git)
├── notebook.ipynb        # Main Jupyter Notebook (if used)
├── analysis.py           # Python script for analysis (if applicable)
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python **3.8+** installed. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` doesn’t exist, manually install:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## ▶️ Usage

Run the analysis in Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or execute the Python script:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

## 📊 Features

* Load and clean datasets with **pandas**
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualize results with **matplotlib**
* Use **scikit-learn** datasets (e.g., Iris dataset)

## 📝 Notes

* `metadata.csv` is ignored in `.gitignore` to avoid uploading raw data.
* The virtual environment (`venv/`) is also ignored.

## 📜 License

This project is for educational purposes. You may adapt and extend it as needed.

Do you want me to **customize this README.md** specifically for a **Jupyter Notebook workflow** (since I see `.ipynb_checkpoints/` in `.gitignore`) or keep it as a **Python script + notebook hybrid**?
